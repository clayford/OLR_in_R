## CODE ALONG 1

- Investigate the Age variable
- Investigate the Sex variable


summary(Arthritis$Age)
hist(Arthritis$Age)
stripchart(Age ~ Improved, data = Arthritis)

xtabs(~ Sex, data = Arthritis)


## CODE ALONG 2

- Fit an ordinal regression model with Treatment, Sex, and Age. Call it `m2`. Include `Hess = TRUE` in `polr()`

m2 <- polr(Improved ~ Treatment + Sex + Age, 
           data = Arthritis, Hess = TRUE)
summary(m2)

- Assess proportional odds assumption
poTest(m2)
rms::plot.xmean.ordinaly(Improved ~ Treatment + Sex + Age, data = Arthritis)

- Interpret the coefficients
exp(confint(m2))

Interpretation: 

- The estimated odds that a Treated subject's response has higher improvement is at least 2.3 times the odds that a Placebo subject's response has higher improvement, perhaps as high as 15 times, holding all other variables constant.
- The estimated odds that a Male subject's response has higher improvement is at least 20% lower (1 - 0.80) than the odds that a Female subject's response has higher improvement, perhaps as much as 91% lower, holding all other variables constant.
- The estimated odds that a subject has higher improvement increases by at least 0.3% for each 1 year increase in age, perhaps as much as 7%, holding all other variables constant.

- Visualize the model with effect displays.

ggeffect(m2, terms = "Age") |> plot()
ggeffect(m2, terms = "Treatment") |> plot(connect.lines = TRUE)
ggeffect(m2, terms = "Sex") |> plot(connect.lines = TRUE)


- Is the model with three predictors an improvement over the model with 1 predictor?

anova(m1, m2)

- assessment model via simulation

sims2 <- simulate(m2, nsim = 200)
p_df <- function(x){
  xtabs(~ x) |> 
  proportions() |>
  as.data.frame(responseName = "P")
  }
sims_pdf2 <- lapply(sims2, p_df) |> 
  do.call(what = "rbind",args = _)
ggplot() +
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = x, y = P), 
             data = sims_pdf2, alpha = 0.25,
             width = 0.1, height = 0) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Improved, y = P), 
             data = obs_pdf, size = 4, color = "blue") 

```
