Ordinal Logistic Regression in R
Code along answers

## CODE ALONG 1

- Investigate the Age variable
- Investigate the Sex variable

xtabs(~ Sex + Improved, data = Arthritis) |> 
  proportions(margin = 1) |> 
  apply(1, cumsum) |> 
  t()

summary(Arthritis$Age)
hist(Arthritis$Age)
plot(Improved ~ Age, data = Arthritis)
stripchart(Age ~ Improved, data = Arthritis)


## CODE ALONG 2

m2 <- polr(Improved ~ Treatment + Sex, data = Arthritis)
exp(coef(m2))

The estimated odds that a Treated subject's response has higher improvement is about 6 times higher than the odds that a Placebo subject's response has higher improvement. 


## CODE ALONG 3 

Assess the proportional odds assumption of model `m2` from the previous CODE ALONG.

poTest(m2)
rms::plot.xmean.ordinaly(Improved ~ Sex, data = Arthritis)


## CODE ALONG 4

Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the Treatment coefficient of model `m2` and interpret.

exp(confint(m2))

The estimated odds that a Treated subject's response has higher improvement is at least 2.5 times the odds that a Placebo subject's response has higher improvement, perhaps as high as 15 times, adjusted for Sex.


## CODE ALONG 5

emmeans(m2, ~ Improved|Treatment, mode = "prob")
emmeans(m2, ~ Improved|Treatment, mode = "prob") |> plot()


## CODE ALONG 6


- Fit an ordinal regression model with Treatment, Sex, and Age. Call it `m4`. Include `Hess = TRUE` in `polr()`

m4 <- polr(Improved ~ Treatment + Sex + Age, 
           data = Arthritis, Hess = TRUE)
summary(m4)

- Assess proportional odds assumption
poTest(m4)
rms::plot.xmean.ordinaly(Improved ~ Treatment + Sex + Age, data = Arthritis)

- Interpret the coefficients
exp(confint(m4))

Interpretation: 

- The estimated odds that a Treated subject's response has higher improvement is at least 2.3 times the odds that a Placebo subject's response has higher improvement, perhaps as high as 15 times, holding all other variables constant.
- The estimated odds that a Male subject's response has higher improvement is at least 20% lower (1 - 0.80) than the odds that a Female subject's response has higher improvement, perhaps as much as 91% lower, holding all other variables constant.
- The estimated odds that a subject has higher improvement increases by at least 0.3% for each 1 year increase in age, perhaps as much as 7%, holding all other variables constant.

- Visualize the model with effect displays.

ggeffect(m4, terms = "Age") |> plot()
ggeffect(m4, terms = "Treatment") |> plot(connect_lines = TRUE)
ggeffect(m4, terms = "Sex") |> plot(connect_lines = TRUE)


- Is the model with three predictors (m4) an improvement over the model with 2 predictors (m2)?
